# escape-gap-algorithm
This GitHub repository contains the C++ source code that implements a novel algorithm called Escape Gap (EG). This algorithm allows a robot both to safely navigate through narrow spaces and to escape from large obstacles, even when these obstacles have a shape that makes very difficult to find a way out. Moreover, all this is done in accordance with the spirit of the reactive/sense-act paradigm, which means that all decisions about the robotâ€™s actions are merely made using local information of the environment.
