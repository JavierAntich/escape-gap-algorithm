Nowadays, there are many tools for facilitating robot programming. Among these tools, two of the most well-known are MRPT (Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit, https://www.mrpt.org/) and ROS (Robot Operating System, http://www.ros.org/). MRPT provides a set of well-tested applications and libraries covering data structures and algorithms employed in common robotics research areas.

This GitHub repository contains the C++ source code that implements a novel algorithm called Escape Gap (EG). This algorithm allows a robot both to safely navigate through narrow spaces and to escape from large obstacles, even when these obstacles have a shape that makes very difficult to find a way out. Moreover, all this is done in accordance with the spirit of the reactive/sense-act paradigm, which means that all decisions about the robotâ€™s actions are merely made using local information of the environment.

EG has been integrated into the MRPT application named Holonomic Navigator Demo (https://www.mrpt.org/list-of-mrpt-apps/application-holonomic-navigator-demo/). This application provides a friendly Graphical User Interface to test the EG algorithm in simulation.
